    "Review 2": "The food at Curry Express is top-notch along with their always friendly service! Belgrade is lucky to have this place as a lunch option!",
    "Review 3": "I was happy with my chicken curry and garlic naan.  If you like spicy I would ask for spicier than medium, I asked for medium and wished for a bit more. The flavor was good. Not a ton of food so don‚Äôt plan on sharing. My desi girlfriend came with me, it was her suggestion because she loves Indian food. She wasn‚Äôt thrilled with her meal.  Our main complaint was the raita, it looked more like melted butter than yogurt which is what I‚Äôm used to. I understand that many places make raita differently but this didn‚Äôt really look like raita. I attached a picture, I‚Äôm curious what y‚Äôall think.",
    "Review 4": "Very very good food. Like reallllly good Indian food. Service and hours are hit and miss, wish they were more consistent in both, but they are also a very nice family. I think people in our area would go more if these things were figured out but don‚Äôt let that stop you. Worth it once you eat.",
    "Review 5": "I‚Äôve gone twice this week and both times I‚Äôve had a great experience, food is good and service is amazing. Nicola, the waitress is a gracious, detail oriented girl that takes care of every detail to make your experience outstanding"

    "Review 3": "Picked up food.online order. Food: chili chicken- spicy, kofta curry, veg biriyani, butter and bullet naan Chili chicken- so v sweet, a huge let down :( Kofta curry- the koftas were bad,doughy and inedible.the liquid curry was flavorful and good Naan- good Veg biriyy- not great.... but okay.",
    "Review 4": "Must try! We went their on Monday so the place wasn't crowded. We ordered some North Indian dishes and all of us were amazed by the taste. Didn't expect it from an Indian restaurant in Montana. I can say it is easily one of the best authentic Indian food places you'll find. Their staff is very accommodating and the service was also good. Not too expensive and definitely value for money.",
    "Review 5": "Food was okay, rather bland and lacking in spices. For an Indian restaurant in Montana this is to be expected and this was one of the only Indian restaurants that was within a semi-reasonable drive of West Yellowstone (about 1 and a half hours). The staff provided great service and that definitely made the experience better."

Highly recommend this restaurant.  I am so pleased that this is a food choice in GF. We are excited to eat here again, dine in or take out.  All my family had a favorite dish, of six presented to us.",

    "Review 2": "One thing I miss about living in a big city is the food. It's easy to find a burger in MT, but this place is a rare find for the state. The food at Masala took me back home, but without all the traffic and horrible people which come with big city life. Will eat here again next time I'm in Missoula.\n",

As so many fast food companies have figured out, there is nothing wrong with sticking to basics. This is not \"fast food\" but you are sitting, eating quickly. Definitely adds variety to Missoula's limited culinary offerings.",
    "Review 5": "They have alot of really great authentic tasting food, and I'm only guessing at how the menu could be better, but I did have a little difficulty figuring out how it works. A great place for some spicy food with healthy options"

He loves fried chicken and I don't make it. So, he is double lucky when he can find broasted chicken. I had the beef brisket dinner. Lots of food, more than enough for four let alone the two of us! Everything was good and they also make Indian fry bread. Couldn't ask for a better meal, famous for their bar-b-que!",

    "Review 5": "Finally!! I was beginning to think this area had no good food but we really enjoyed our meal here. Considering the other places it was a great value. Good service. Our only issue was the ribs came out cold but they took care of it. My rotisseries chicken was juicy and had a great flavor. Loved all the sides that came with it. Highly recommend."

We had to wait an hour and the other patrons had big bags of food. The highest price I heard the rude lady say was $57.65. and he had a lot of food, she hands Me the small bag and says $70.00 ok no problem but when My Daughter went in the bag to get her food. Everything was for 1 person, a small box of Jasmine Rice and a container of butter chicken that we could not eat individually. The hostess was rude I felt overcharged for our food purposely and we couldn't eat til we got home. I paid close to $100 for bad service and the kids running around the food in the kitchen where customers can see them. I would bring many to them but I don't want to be embarrassed because of their service. Rude lady should take a course on being a good hostess.",
    "Review 2": "We were traveling from Massachusetts to New York when we came across this restaurant and so glad we found it. It was really late and all other restaurants on the way had closed for the day. We were starving and just happened to call them to see if they were open. We reached just as they were about to close but the owners were kind to let us dine in. We had veg biryani, paneer kadai and garlic naan. Biryani ani kadai was good. The naan was slightly uncooked. The dahi raita was sour and slightly butter so we couldn't eat it. Overall good experience. The decor was nice, restrooms were clean.",
    "Review 3": "Had a dinner here with my colleague. We ordered Amritsari Dal, bhindi and garlic naans. For appetizers we wanted gobi manchurian which was not on menu but we asked. Hostess suggested we try gobi 65 which was not on menu either but she said chef will make it. It was amazing. Crunchy gobi with lots of flavor. Dal and Bhindi was awesome too. Naans we‚Äôre one of the best. It is very authentic Punjabi restaurant so if you want to eat good Punjabi food, go here.",
    "Review 4": "This is the best Indian food I have had since moving to this area. The samosas are excellent and the Chicken Vindaloo is the best I have every had. It is perfectly spicy and vinegary. If you enjoy spicy food, I highly recommend their Vindaloo. I‚Äôm sure the lamb and veggie Vindaloo would be great as well. Excellent garlic naan as well. I will absolutely be back soon!",

    "Review 2": "Yummm. Authentic Chole Bhatura (don‚Äôt miss). Amazing Onion Rava Masala Dosa. If you can‚Äôt imagine how one restaurant can serve both ‚Äúflawless‚Äù dishes, one from Deep South and one from deep Punjab, then check them out and decide for your self.",
    "Review 3": "Management has changed, chef changed and whole experience changed. Some money making Indian wanting to just run a restaurant with stale foods! Change your decision if you ever planned to have that desperate Indian food at this place.",
    "Review 4": "I was told to try out this restaurant because it‚Äôs so good. Well I got the chicken tikka masala and the chicken was good, but it didn‚Äôt come with any rice. I called about the issue and was told if I wanted rice I‚Äôd have to pay for it. I immediately lost my appetite after that and didn‚Äôt finish the food. I paid over $20 for chicken only üòë. Very disappointing. This has to be a joke. I hope the restaurant see‚Äôs this as an error.",
    "Review 5": "Wow. This is Excellent Indian. Chennai is truly a must try.  This is as authentic Indian as you will find here in Rhode Island. I am in awe that a place this amazing sits in a hole in the wall on Reservoir Ave.  Everytime I am here the restaurant is filled with individuals enjoying their meal. Smiling, laughing and sharing time over great food. High praise to the family at Chennai for bringing us wonderful food with great flavor. You can tell they love what they do. You can taste the love in the food. Great job Chennai and thank you! We will see you soon. Pictures are of Tikki Massala and I tried the Kadai Chicken. Delish and something new for a lot of individuals.",

The starters were very delicious. For the main course, we ordered 2 thalis, and goat biryani. The quantity is more than usual restaurant and very delicious.The attending person, Prakash is very soft spoken and asked for feedback if the food is ok. Finally they also gave us tea before leaving.",

The food was delicious (we got the dining for two deal, getting the Mango Curry and the Fish Curry for our entrees). This was truly a memorable dining spot for me and my wife.",
    "Review 4": "I had never ventured into Indian food until meeting my partner in 2019. He finally got to take me to India and he can do it again. The door opens and the smell of curry ignites your hunger. Everything is cooked to perfection. The taste is better than imagined. Venture out and try India.",
    "Review 5": "India is one of Providence's best restaurants in general and a cultural gem for the city. The atmosphere, lighting, and general feel of the setting is perfect to match their menu. Service was excellent, very helpful in catering to any special requests. Food was delicious as expected. Many seating options, inside and outside, the menu is very fairly priced for the quality of food you are getting. A great selection of cocktails and drinks to choose from, typically busy on weekend nights but they also have an in house Henna artist doing free henna work available to patrons, a great opportunity.\n",

    "Review 5": "Their South Indian food cuisine is top notch, especially their dosas and chole bahture! Although the space is small there is a lot of love! The owner of the restaurant was very kind and helpful.",

    "Review 2": "Wonderful restaurant.  Service was a bit scattered, but I am giving servers a pass during the pandemic.  Most importantly, the food was delicious!  I live spicy food, but I have learned not the ask for \"hot\" in an Indian restaurant.  Medium was just fine to give me the kick I wanted without intense pain.  I had goat, and it melted in my mouth.  My wife had a vegan avocado dish.  She couldn't stop singing it's praises.  We came here to celebrate our 26th anniversary and we weren't disappointed.",
    "Review 3": "Good naan and tasty sauce. $2 extra for garlic naan vs plain naan. Dry chicken. Slow in dining service. Attentive water refills. Quiet and not busy. On the expensive side of things. Entrees can be portioned into 2 servings.",
    "Review 4": "Amazing, amazing, amazing! We were walking past this new restaurant and wanted to check it out. The food came out just amazing, the naans were full of onion and garlic making it the best we have ever tried. We also tried the fried okras which is 10/10. The cauliflower tasted great too. The waitress Ritu was also very knowledgeable and recommended some of the dishes that were outside of our comfort zone and tasted great! Will definitely come back!",
    "Review 5": "Let me first start off by saying that the food was very authentic and fresh, and I highly recommend a visit.  My only knock was most likely due to a staffing shortage, as 1 person was visible doing everything to wait on all tables.  Food took a while to arrive.",

Plus, it‚Äôs small portions and expensive. The place was nice, the waitress was nice, another employee too but unfortunately, I came here expecting to have, above all, good food.",

    "Review 4": "Average food, staff lacks interest. not allergy aware, told me they could not guarantee specific ingredient will not be in my food (lemon juice). when asked for a piece of onion, informed me it will cost $2.25 for \"Indian salad\". I have never ever been charged extra for a piece of onion in any Indian restaurant before this.",
    "Review 5": "Great samosas, great garlic naan, great mango lassi, and great papadams. Their chicken tikka masala is also excellent and the lunch portion is generous. Reason for the four star review is their chicken vindaloo. It really lacked the spice, tang, and the wow factor that I usually get from a great vindaloo. It‚Äôs my go to dish and this left me very disappointed. However, everything else was so good I‚Äôll definitely be back and will try something else!",

Yet when it comes to Indian, we are looking for a local business that serves intoxicatingly aromatic and great food, to  return to over and over again. Punjab is that place. Fresh food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. That and all at the best prices within 20 miles of any establishment serving Indian around!?

You don't normally see that! Our waiter was attentive and friendly! Even brought out a spice he wanted us to try and it was amazing! Really, felt like a VIP or something at this place! Oh and their menu, literally is amazing!",
    "Review 5": "Ordered food to go and it was ready in a flash and still nice and hot when we ate it.  Had butter chicken and ordered medium heat which was the right amount for me.  Also ordered garlic naan and ginger/honey naan.  Both good. Lots and lots of ginger so it you do not like whole ginger this wouldn‚Äôt be for you. I happen to love it so was delighted. Very clean and easy to find.  Will dine in next time for the full experience.  Portions a little smaller than our typical go to place for Indian food - that‚Äôs the only reason for the 4 stars.",

Path to the restroom is clumsy and sort of demonstrated the unhygienic conditions. Also the raw materials like tomatoes were from Costco cans. Parking is plenty and shared.",

We had Chicken Makhni & Lamb Saag with Basmati Rice (all GF). My friend had the Butter Naan flat bread (not GF) and she said the texture and flavor was perfect. A little pricey but good portions and great, friendly service. Going back soon! See you there! . . . Almost forgot dessert! Never had anything like Gulab Japan . . . so delicious!! Namaste!",

    "Review 4": "Fantastic, flavorful Indian cuisine, clear social distancing rules, and open for dine-in or take out. They no longer are serving their lunch buffet (for now), but their new lunch specials allow you to make a mini-buffet for yourself or to share. They have both vegetarian and vegan options and will customize the spice to suit your tastes. The vibe is cozy and well decorated with wood panels and cultural accents. Server was so kind and the chef was a cool, friendly guy. Seriously, folks, there's nothing but love waiting for you at Bombay. Come get some!",
    "Review 5": "Used to be 5 star. Over the last year though, the quality has decreased to where it is today. Just spent $100 on chicken and lamb Tikka masala that tastes like spicy tomato bisque. Doesn't even have any vegetables, and the meat is sparing. A far cry from the quality of a year ago. Will not be returning.",

    "Review 1": "Now that was some good food.  The tamarind sauce and mint chutney where both very good.  Perfect spice level for the medium tikka masala that included nice cuts of well marinated chicken.  The staff was being extra careful with covid safety as well.",
    "Review 2": "Delicious food and good with quantity too. Just be careful while ordering the spice level as we ordered medium spicy and that is way too spicy compared to spice level we usually get in USA",
    "Review 3": "Nice restaurant and wonderful staff. Food was terrific must try masala dosa and mango lassi",
    "Review 4": "Tried it for the first time tonight, pretty good stuff cooked to order. I had the lamb with medium spice level and it was right.Vegetarian options: It‚Äôs Indian of course they have a veg option",
    "Review 5": "The masala dosa was really good, it comes with sambar (the soup-like dish in the upper left). The mango lassi was delicious. The samosas are huge!! Totally worth it, and pairs well with the tamirind sauce.",

    "Review 1": "The best Northern Indian food (we asked lol)! We will definitely be back again! We took all our left over home and ordered additional naan bread to eat with our leftovers. My little boy loves everything, especially their masala fries. Customer service was awesome! Overall experience 10/10! Thank you for the wonderful food and service!",
    "Review 2": "The BEST place HANDS DOWN to get Indian food far and wide. I love Hari Om's beautiful space and incredibly prepared dishes. They are authentic and  delicious. Amit is very hands on and is usually preparing your food and serving your table. Nothing but the best from Hari Om every time! Thank you for being a little slice of heaven in our frozen tundra. <3 - Heidi Oh & do NOT sleep on the samosas, you will regret it. Plus great healthy vegan friendly options.",

    "Review 4": "Great ambiance and service with a smile. If your looking for real Indian food experience this is the place. The food was very good. I got the Thali Platter which had the chicken massala(?sp) with it. It was a decent sampler of foods but no lamb. Perhaps next time for that.",
    "Review 5": "We went for a late dinner after arriving in Fairbanks. This place is has equal numbers of vegetarian vs meat options. My friend got the veggie thali, and I got lamb shahi with garlic naan. Everything was delicious. We finished the meal with hot chai which were spiced perfectly. The staff are very friendly and the interior of the restaurant is super colorful and very serene. Loved the art done by local artists. Definitely recommended!",

    "Review 1": "After dining here a couple of times, I have come to the conclusion that it is my favorite Indian food in all of Juneau. (Honestly, best I've had anywhere) The owner is super nice and added her own spin to popular dishes. If you ask for hot, it will be hot, so if you are white, be careful! The chicken tika is so tender that you can tell the chicken receives special treatments in the back when nobody is looking. Possibly a 24-hour marinate, or who knows, maybe it's been wined and dined before lights out. I would write more, but you all are hungry and  found where you need to go, so get to spice... You will thank me later. Dine in: Yes Outdoor seating: No Takeout: Yes",

    "Review 4": "The atmosphere was calm, in contrast to the heavy spice smell. The food was amazing  in both flavor, look, and smell. Would go again soon",
    "Review 5": "Incredible meal! We were the first customers of today's soft opening and were very satisfied with everything we had. The new owner Nimmy has done an amazing job with the decor and is very passionate about home style cooking. Would paddle our kayaks 300 miles again to Juneau to eat here!",

The pizza was a pleasant surprise. Was very flavorful. It's a soft crust pizza, would not describe it as a hearty crust (has bend). Fair price and bountiful in toppings without being overloaded. A bit cheese heavy for me, but that is personal preference and I suspect is  perfect for the majority of people. According to the owner they are open regardless of holidays and weather. Not a great place to sit and eat, order ahead recommended.",
    "Review 2": "If you get the chance, try this local locally owned food. They home make all their Pizza's and it was amazing. Hands down, the best pizza I ever had!",
    "Review 3": "We came in late on the train and after both Wendy‚Äôs and McDonalds were closed we were fortunate enough to walk by this little place. Great sandwiches at a very reasonable price and we even have leftovers for tomorrow. The owner was so nice and I‚Äôm glad we got to support local business. The whole experience really turned our night around. We‚Äôll definitely be back next time we‚Äôre in town.",
    "Review 4": "While the lady in the front seems like she is having a bad day, the pizza was delicious! We had the veggie pizza and the vegetables were fresh and the cheese they used was so much better than other pizzas I‚Äôve tasted before. Will definitely be come back for more.",
    "Review 5": "Family owned restaurant, quality food, and exceptionally priced. To my knowledge it's a man and his wife. If they deliver to you, it's usually the dude that cooked the food driving it to you. If you ask for a delivery during a food rush, it might take a while for them to get it to you. Just be patient and prepare your stomach for some sensational cuisine. I ordered my first pizza (Mamma Mia) from them yesterday and had it delivered. Well worth the wait. Halal food.",
