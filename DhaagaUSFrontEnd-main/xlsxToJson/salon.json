I‚Äôve tried so many and the first time I tried to visit Devi‚Äôs she was on vacation. I finally was able to go back again and try her. I told her what I wanted in the beginning and let her do her magic. She slayed my eye brows and I didn‚Äôt even have to tell her to complete a touch up at the end or anything. She shaped them perfectly and removed all of the hair outside of my eye brow shape. Love that she did it in one shot and didn‚Äôt have to have me tell her to fix anything! She‚Äôs for sure the best in RI and hiiiighly recommend her, she knows how to do eyebrows!",

    "Review 2": "Hema is the only person I trust with my eyebrows. She is so professional, talented, and kind. I always leave her salon feeling confident and 100% satisfied with my experience. She is absolutely amazing I can not recommend her enough. I just had my eyebrows tinted by her for the first time and they look the best I have ever seen them. I will never go to another threader again!",

    "Review 1": "I liked the results of my eyebrows once they were done, but the attitude given to me was terribly unpleasant and unprofessional. The eye rolls, scoffs, and dirty looks were unnecessary. She then began to get pushy, even though I had said it was my first time. She crossed the line when she began pushing my head back and aggressively rearranging my hands to hold up the skin, where she was threading. She made my experience unpleasant and humiliating. Beware they are not afraid to rip the skin off your face if they don‚Äôt like you. I recommend that you teach your employees how to communicate with your customers better.",
    "Review 2": "The lady (I forgot her name unfortunately) was extremely nice the first time I went here. I was with a group of friends and she offered us free Henna because we couldn't afford it at the time. She was very nice, but very pushy. I understand that it's good to try to be pushy in business, but she crossed the line a bit. Overall, it was a pretty good experience the first time, but the second time wasn't really. We couldn't decide if we wanted to get our upper lips waxed (me and my friend) and my other friend wanted an eyebrow threading. We were sitting on the couches in front when they lady said to come to the back room with her because she wanted to show us something. We said okay although we were confused as to what she wanted to show us. She took us back and then said \"Who's first\". At this point we felt we didn't have a choice although we were very nervous to do this. We told her it was our first time and she tried to comfort us, but in a very pushy way. When it was my turn to go she started immediately (I was not ready). I kept moving because I was extremely nervous and she told me to stop, but didn't give me a chance to. When she did wax my upper lip she didn't get all of it and left remnants at the top. I wish I could have given a better review, this is just my opinion of the experience.",
    "Review 3": "My first time going there was an okay experience, this lady was tall and she did an okay job with my brows. She took a decent amount of time doing each brow. I then went to go the second time, I didn‚Äôt have the same lady, this lady was much shorter, first off I was waiting out of the store, she saw me through the reflection of the mirror, but didn‚Äôt seated me because she was ON THE PHONE. Five minutes went by and she seating me, then I saw her put on her airpods, so clearly she was on a call while doing my brows. I told her I wanted cleaning no shape nothing! She did the complete opposite! She ruined my brows! My brows used to be super thick and now they are super thin!! She also did both of my brows under 10 minutes! Worst service, highly unprofessional! I literally cried when I went home. I still paid but it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Ladies don‚Äôt go here!!!  If y‚Äôall have thick brows this isn‚Äôt the place for you!",
    "Review 4": "I left a review on this site about 6-7 months ago speaking about employees charging me extra and taking tips. On their site it is listed as $10. They charge me $12 and whenever I had cash, usually a $20, they would give me $7 back, they stole extra money from me every time. November 27th, an employee came up to me, questioned me about my review and made me change my review. She was extremely rude and she straight up ambushed me. I've gone to this place for years and I felt so disrespected. Upon speaking to her I felt ambushed, and she forced me to delete my review. She was pushy and told me to lie and say that they give good service. Never again.",
    "Review 5": "I went for upper lips and the girl name SABINA is super rude and always give me a  bad look .I never go to her. But the day I went she took me for upper lips and when I told her, that my upper lips is not clean properly, she got frustrated on me and started yelling at me and keep telling me bad stuff. Who does treat there customer's like this?? I have seen SABINA and other  girls making fun of  customer's and talk in there own Nepali language. Very unprofessional staff specifically SABINA. She thinks she owns the place and she is the boss. Lots of customers have complained, but I guess the owner Neelu does not care. Please guys do not go the girl SABINA. Neelu if you really care about your customers then you need to talk to SABINA. Being rude to customers is not going to help her neither you. Respect your customers and stop making fun and speaking in your native language in front of your customer. Guys be aware about this place. Hope some action being taken against SABINA.",

The following month my card was charged again. I contacted every single location and told them I have cancelled online and emailed and they all told me that emailing was the best way to cancel. I contacted my bank at this point because it had been over a month of emailing and cancelling online and getting the run around with calling each location. My bank rectified the situation for that month and then again I find out this month I was charged AGAIN. At this point I had emailed multiple emails I was given, cancelled online multiple times and called and spoke to someone at every location with no resolution.

It is worth it for me since I have my full face threaded, including brows and lip, on a regular basis.  I can go as many times as I want for this service for 1 monthly fee. Highly recommend it.",
    "Review 5": "They are nothing short of amazing! This was my first threading experience and I couldn't have asked for better results! They listened to all my requests and gave great recommendations for future visits. My thin brows end up looking so much fuller and I don't have to fill them in with pencil anymore! I will never pick up a pair of tweezers again.",

I always get a perfect, long lasting medium brown tint that lasts about a month even with me washing and wiping my face all the time! She tidies up my brows perfectly without overdoing it- something most places do even with my already thin eyebrows!! I moved about an hour away and I still only come here!

    "Review 3": "When I lived here 4.5 years ago, I always came here. They always did such a wonderful job. I just moved back to Providence, and went to get my eyebrows done and it was a horrible experience. Not only did she take one hair out at a time, she was extremely slow so it was very painful. She also didn‚Äôt listen to me, made my eyebrows too thin, then when I tried to ask her a couple questions at the end she didn‚Äôt understand what I was trying to say. So I left crying.Such a bad experience. I really loved it here and now that I live right down the street. It is more of a hassle to go to another place. But I‚Äôm definitely not coming back. Worst threading experience in my life. And I have been getting my eyebrows threaded for 10 years.",

    "Review 2": "I absolutely love coming here to get my eyebrows threaded! Out of all the places I have been in the past, Salon Thread is the best one yet, Nilima does an amazing job!!!",
    "Review 3": "I have had a monthly membership with this establishment for over a year. At 17 dollars a month, I can go anytime I want, how often I want, and I always get service with a smile. In your membership, you also get free bottled water or cans of soda, plus there is a coffee machine if you so desire. Mona is my preferred eyebrow specialist as she is fantastic and makes sure there is not one hair out of place on my brows. In fact, I usually don't stop there unless I see her car parked outside. Not only does she treat me with respect, but, she also makes me feel welcomed and has this friendly vibe about her. I completely trust her with my eyebrows and that's a big deal to someone like me. I don't go anywhere else for this service! I highly recommend going at least once. I'm usually in an out within 5 minutes and there are so fast I've never spent more than 2 minutes waiting to be seen. If you're a first-timer, request Mona; you won't regret it. Two more things, there is always plenty of parking AND they are kid-friendly. They always address my 7 year old and give him a treat :) 10/10 I highly recommend!",
    "Review 4": "Today was my first time going to Threading Spot, Cumberland RI. I am absolutely AMAZED by the work and personality of Nilima. She did beautiful work to my awful eyebrows & treated me with the most respect. I recommend if you visit this location you make sure to see Nilima, you will leave 100% satisfied and wanting to come back!!!",
    "Review 5": "Nilima is extremely thorough with her threading techniques. She is receptive to feedback on the areas of focus and areas to avoid. I'm happy with the results after each session and enjoy having my monthly membership at this location as I get quality work done by Nilima while helping me save.",

When I brought it to their attention they said I was the \"first\" wax of the day but it was 4 pm and I had just seen a woman leave the room before me. Long story short they are unsanitary and don't take the time to perform safe hygiene on their clients. The owner even mentioned that her employee was new and normally they don‚Äôt do that, however even after admitting that they would still not give me a refund. You're better off spending more money at a reputable place that is safe.",

    "Review 1": "This is the best place around. Eyebrows for $10 is so cheap and they do such a great job. The girl who did mine was so nice, did a great job, and it didn't even hurt. Best threading of my life. I highly recommend it.",
    "Review 2": "Do not waste your time here. With so many other threading places, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. First and last time coming here. They do not know the art of eyebrow shaping, nor how to shape a thick eyebrow. You get what you pay for, and if you care about your eyebrows and how they look, pay an extra $5 more and you will be much more satisfied.",
    "Review 3": "Excellent threading by a phenomenal & friendly staff.",
    "Review 4": "Good work but not such a fan of them asking for the tip in cash. I don't always carry cash but the women even asked me to go check me car üôÑ.",
    "Review 5": "I told her as soon as I sat in her chair that I was trying to grow out my eyebrows and just wanted them cleaned up and realized it was taking her quite a bit to do. She told me one eyebrow was different than the other, which I had told her I have been working on letting them fill in and she ended up reshaping them and getting rid of the growth I had. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend especially when you ask for a specific request of just cleaning them up.",

    "Review 1": "Horrible experience. The girl I had was soo rude. All she did was talk the whole time she did my brows.  The left one ended up smaller than the right and I had to fill it in.  So rude I will NEVER go there again.  I will tell all my friends to NEVER step foot in there.  RUDE !!",
    "Review 2": "I went today to get my eyebrows done and unfortunately I won‚Äôt be returning. Not once but twice they messed up my brows.  This time I got two different shapes.  It‚Äôs not first time time they have done them there before but the last two ladies it‚Äôs not know what they aware doing.  I have the shape all you have to do is clean around them.  Sorry but won‚Äôt be returning.    1/17/ 2020 After an unfortunate visit I surprised, the owner reached out and wanted to know what happed.  Glad she reached out And fixed my eyebrows.  I will return to her location thank you!",
    "Review 3": "I've never been to this location usually go to the Pawtucket one but the same ladies work in all of them. There was only one woman there but she was quick and efficient never left anybody waiting more than a few minutes. I went for a threading and tint, she was gentle thank God cuz a couple of them... mannn... and she did a okay job on them. tbh there's only one lady that gets my brows exactly the way I like them but I go there like once every couple months just to remind me where to pluck, n I don't see her much so I always forget her name.",
    "Review 4": "This place is very clean and tidy! They do a beautiful job with the threading and they come out perfectly even each time! Their pricing is also very fair. I highly recommend!",
    "Review 5": "I was reading someone‚Äôs review and I had the exact same experience my eyebrows got messed up two different shapes. I always have to let them regrow before I can go back hoping this time they won‚Äôt get messed up. Sadly they do. Some might ask why do I keep going there; because I went there before and this lady did a great job hope to find her there again. Anyways I saw that the owner reached out to the lady and did them her self hopefully she‚Äôll see this and reach out!",

    "Review 1": "Completely shocked at how I was just treated by the older woman who works here. I‚Äôm from out of state looking to get my brows done and this place had good reviews. They woman asked what shape and I said please just clean them up and keep them thick as possible. She said your eyebrows are different shape and sizes. Made me feel uncomfortable and not very nice. I said I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs how they grow.. she was very condescending. Then when I was done she asked me to look in the mirror and my eyes were watery (as they always are bc I have contacts and holding my eyes) so she asks if she made me cry?? Very odd experience. Then she rung me out- I didn‚Äôt feel like tipping but I gave less than I would have. Will not return. As a small business owner- it would be nice to treat people nicely. So many other nice businesses out there that I would rather spend money on:/",
    "Review 2": "I love coming here to clean my eyebrows. Very affordable, make sure to bring cash or use an onsite ATM",
    "Review 3": "I have been going here for over 10 years. They do an absolutely amazing job. I hate to write negative things on this business because I really do love them but the younger girl needs a little bit more training -it absolutely kills when she threads my eyebrows. They still look very nice though but i would prefer the two other women that have been here for years",
    "Review 4": "I don‚Äôt ever write reviews, but I just have to share that I have been visiting unique eyebrow threading since they opened in 2007. I would never think of going anywhere else but here. The staff is amazing and I just love the owner! I always walk out happy and my eyebrows and my lip come out perfect every single time!! If you are thinking about going to get your eyebrows threaded believe me it is much better than waxing and plucking like I do sometimes when I don‚Äôt have time lol this is the absolute best place to get services!",
    "Review 5": "I like going to the older lady in the first chair I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs the owner but she always does an excellent job. The few times I‚Äôve went to the younger girl in the second chair she messed up my eyebrows and had me in the chair for under a minute before she told me that I was done. I mentioned clean up only and not too thin and always leaves them super thin or a completely different shape from one another  because she rushes.",
