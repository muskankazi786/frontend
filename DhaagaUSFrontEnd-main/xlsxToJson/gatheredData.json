    "Review 1": "My Daughter is 12 years old, She ordered the butter chicken for her and Myself so we could go to the drive in theater. We had to wait an hour and the other patrons had big bags of food. The highest price I heard the rude lady say was $57.65. and he had a lot of food, she hands Me the small bag and says $70.00 ok no problem but when My Daughter went in the bag to get her food. Everything was for 1 person, a small box of Jasmine Rice and a container of butter chicken that we could not eat individually. The hostess was rude I felt overcharged for our food purposely and we couldn't eat til we got home. I paid close to $100 for bad service and the kids running around the food in the kitchen where customers can see them. I would bring many to them but I don't want to be embarrassed because of their service. Rude lady should take a course on being a good hostess.",
    "Review 2": "We were traveling from Massachusetts to New York when we came across this restaurant and so glad we found it. It was really late and all other restaurants on the way had closed for the day. We were starving and just happened to call them to see if they were open. We reached just as they were about to close but the owners were kind to let us dine in. We had veg biryani, paneer kadai and garlic naan. Biryani ani kadai was good. The naan was slightly uncooked. The dahi raita was sour and slightly butter so we couldn't eat it. Overall good experience. The decor was nice, restrooms were clean.",
    "Review 3": "Had a dinner here with my colleague. We ordered Amritsari Dal, bhindi and garlic naans. For appetizers we wanted gobi manchurian which was not on menu but we asked. Hostess suggested we try gobi 65 which was not on menu either but she said chef will make it. It was amazing. Crunchy gobi with lots of flavor. Dal and Bhindi was awesome too. Naans we‚Äôre one of the best. It is very authentic Punjabi restaurant so if you want to eat good Punjabi food, go here.",
    "Review 4": "This is the best Indian food I have had since moving to this area. The samosas are excellent and the Chicken Vindaloo is the best I have every had. It is perfectly spicy and vinegary. If you enjoy spicy food, I highly recommend their Vindaloo. I‚Äôm sure the lamb and veggie Vindaloo would be great as well. Excellent garlic naan as well. I will absolutely be back soon!",
    "Review 5": "We enjoyed our time here. The server was quick to get the appetizer running but the entrees took longer than we expected it to be. The goat biryani was amazing as well as the chicken kadhai.",

That was the first time we tried Indian cuisine and‚Ä¶OMG‚Ä¶ we fell in love   The interior is absolutely beautiful, stylish and vibrant. The food was irresistible delicious, we couldn‚Äôt stop eating until we finished our meal to the very last crumble on the plate. Our overall experience was terrific. Thanks to the owner for the love, attention to the details and care of their place. I wish your business  prosperity for years and hope one day we‚Äôll come back",

Very disappointing. This has to be a joke. I hope the restaurant see‚Äôs this as an error.",
    "Review 5": "Wow. This is Excellent Indian. Chennai is truly a must try.  This is as authentic Indian as you will find here in Rhode Island. I am in awe that a place this amazing sits in a hole in the wall on Reservoir Ave.  Everytime I am here the restaurant is filled with individuals enjoying their meal. Smiling, laughing and sharing time over great food. High praise to the family at Chennai for bringing us wonderful food with great flavor. You can tell they love what they do. You can taste the love in the food. Great job Chennai and thank you! We will see you soon. Pictures are of Tikki Massala and I tried the Kadai Chicken. Delish and something new for a lot of individuals.",

    "Review 1": "Nice tasty food worth the money.. less oily, cooked to perfection and satisfies your taste buds!!",
    "Review 2": "My husband is from India and gets homesick occasionally for really authentic Indian meals. We came for the Sunday buffet and this absolutely hit the spot. The food is so fresh and the staff are very attentive. Great service all around. We'll definitely be back!",
    "Review 3": "Hit or miss. First time try was good so we went again and had a bad experience. The dosa, Gobi Manchuria was good. Bajji was so oily that I had to squeeze out oil. Kadai paneer was ok. We had to mix in salt and pepper to bring it to taste. Not an experience I want to have when paying good price. One another customer was so mad with the food that they were going to call the department of health for serving frozen expired food!",
    "Review 4": "The shrimp was so overcooked that it was like we were chewing on rubber. The food overall was just below average in flavor profile and execution. The only reason that this place gets a 2 star is because of how kind and welcoming the wait staff was.",
    "Review 5": "One of the best South Indian Restaurant in the area! Huge menu and all delicious! They serve lunch buffet and they even serve the Bahubali Thali - which has 50 items on the plate! I love the biryanis, Chile bhature, Idli and Dosa!",

    "Review 3": "Incredible experience at India Restaurant. The ambiance was first-rate. The server was helpful, friendly, and attentive.

    "Review 4": "I had never ventured into Indian food until meeting my partner in 2019. He finally got to take me to India and he can do it again. The door opens and the smell of curry ignites your hunger. Everything is cooked to perfection. The taste is better than imagined. Venture out and try India.",
    "Review 5": "India is one of Providence's best restaurants in general and a cultural gem for the city. The atmosphere, lighting, and general feel of the setting is perfect to match their menu. Service was excellent, very helpful in catering to any special requests. Food was delicious as expected. Many seating options, inside and outside, the menu is very fairly priced for the quality of food you are getting. A great selection of cocktails and drinks to choose from, typically busy on weekend nights but they also have an in house Henna artist doing free henna work available to patrons, a great opportunity.",

The food is exceptional and freshly prepared if eating in like we did or with take out.

The service was personable and so very attentive and I know that Sahara will take good care of you too! Don't miss out on this local gem!",

We marveled at how clean everything was including the restroom. Service was sweet and our ice teas were marvelous. In the mood for Indian food, this is the place to go.",

I live spicy food, but I have learned not the ask for \"hot\" in an Indian restaurant.  Medium was just fine to give me the kick I wanted without intense pain.  I had goat, and it melted in my mouth.  My wife had a vegan avocado dish.  She couldn't stop singing it's praises.  We came here to celebrate our 26th anniversary and we weren't disappointed.",
    "Review 3": "Good naan and tasty sauce. $2 extra for garlic naan vs plain naan. Dry chicken. Slow in dining service. Attentive water refills. Quiet and not busy. On the expensive side of things. Entrees can be portioned into 2 servings.",
    "Review 4": "Amazing, amazing, amazing! We were walking past this new restaurant and wanted to check it out. The food came out just amazing, the naans were full of onion and garlic making it the best we have ever tried. We also tried the fried okras which is 10/10. The cauliflower tasted great too. The waitress Ritu was also very knowledgeable and recommended some of the dishes that were outside of our comfort zone and tasted great! Will definitely come back!",
    "Review 5": "Let me first start off by saying that the food was very authentic and fresh, and I highly recommend a visit.  My only knock was most likely due to a staffing shortage, as 1 person was visible doing everything to wait on all tables.  Food took a while to arrive.",

    "Review 4": "Average food, staff lacks interest. not allergy aware, told me they could not guarantee specific ingredient will not be in my food (lemon juice). when asked for a piece of onion, informed me it will cost $2.25 for \"Indian salad\". I have never ever been charged extra for a piece of onion in any Indian restaurant before this.",
    "Review 5": "Great samosas, great garlic naan, great mango lassi, and great papadams. Their chicken tikka masala is also excellent and the lunch portion is generous. Reason for the four star review is their chicken vindaloo. It really lacked the spice, tang, and the wow factor that I usually get from a great vindaloo. It‚Äôs my go to dish and this left me very disappointed. However, everything else was so good I‚Äôll definitely be back and will try something else!",

Yet when it comes to Indian, we are looking for a local business that serves intoxicatingly aromatic and great food, to  return to over and over again. Punjab is that place. Fresh food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. That and all at the best prices within 20 miles of any establishment serving Indian around!?

Oh and their menu, literally is amazing!",
    "Review 5": "Ordered food to go and it was ready in a flash and still nice and hot when we ate it.  Had butter chicken and ordered medium heat which was the right amount for me.  Also ordered garlic naan and ginger/honey naan.  Both good. Lots and lots of ginger so it you do not like whole ginger this wouldn‚Äôt be for you. I happen to love it so was delighted. Very clean and easy to find.  Will dine in next time for the full experience.  Portions a little smaller than our typical go to place for Indian food - that‚Äôs the only reason for the 4 stars.",

If you need an Indian space they have it, but maybe not the brand or specific type you are familiar with from other better stocked Indian grocery stores. It isn't bad, just less variety what I consider normal. But when you need something it is conveniently  located  in East Providence.",

    "Review 3": "Love the service!! So convenient to get fresh groceries at your doorstep! The delivery guys are super friendly. First time they asked us to come out to the main gate so I requested if they can come to my door and the delivery person very nicely agreed and now delivers at my doorstep! I was also hesistant if the groceries would be fresh, but after having used them for about 3-4 months, I can safely say that the groceries are very fresh, infact sometimes more fresh than you would find at the store! I had my parents visiting from India and it was super convenient to have fresh vegetables at home for them like they get in India! I would love to see improvements to the website- like picking items from my last order, additional stores/restaurants serviced. Great job guys!!",
    "Review 4": "Timely service, different stored to order indian grocery from. Giving 4 stars because the website is not full fledged feature rich as you would expect but it's sufficient to place an order. It has friendly service as well. In case you are missing any items from the order drop them an email and you will be refunded (experienced).",
    "Review 5": "Worst customer experience. I ordered 2 butcher boy corn oil online for ~$50 each and they called after I already placed the order that the price just went up. Therefore, they wanted to charge me the extra amount even though online it shows the $50. I said no and they canceled the order saying out of stock. This is not how you treat customers.",

When I asked, if she was using hair glue on my eyelashes, she said no. Smh I paid $35 for nothing üòí üò™ I took off the lashes right away.  Why use hair glue on someone eyes üëÄ ü§î",
    "Review 4": "Got my eyebrows wax by Mrs. Nikki, she was very friendly and kind and I would recommend her any time.Donawea",
    "Review 5": "Don't go here if you're getting waxed. As they were waxing (Brazilian wax) I looked over and saw she was double dipping directly into the wax pot. When I brought it to their attention they said I was the \"first\" wax of the day but it was 4 pm and I had just seen a woman leave the room before me. Long story short they are unsanitary and don't take the time to perform safe hygiene on their clients. The owner even mentioned that her employee was new and normally they don‚Äôt do that, however even after admitting that they would still not give me a refund. You're better off spending more money at a reputable place that is safe.",

It‚Äôs not first time time they have done them there before but the last two ladies it‚Äôs not know what they aware doing.  I have the shape all you have to do is clean around them.  Sorry but won‚Äôt be returning.    1/17/ 2020 After an unfortunate visit I surprised, the owner reached out and wanted to know what happed.  Glad she reached out And fixed my eyebrows.  I will return to her location thank you!",

There was only one woman there but she was quick and efficient never left anybody waiting more than a few minutes. I went for a threading and tint, she was gentle thank God cuz a couple of them... mannn... and she did a okay job on them. tbh there's only one lady that gets my brows exactly the way I like them but I go there like once every couple months just to remind me where to pluck, n I don't see her much so I always forget her name.",

I always have to let them regrow before I can go back hoping this time they won‚Äôt get messed up. Sadly they do. Some might ask why do I keep going there; because I went there before and this lady did a great job hope to find her there again. Anyways I saw that the owner reached out to the lady and did them her self hopefully she‚Äôll see this and reach out!",

They are genuine products, not like you would find on amazon, and are sourced from a small business. They have beautiful jewelry, books, lots of crystals, clothing, incense, and amazing d√©cor. They also offer henna and tarot card readings. They staff is always friendly and happy to help or teach you about their specialties. Always worth a visit, and affordable prices.

She asked about the color I wanted for my tint and I wasn‚Äôt sure‚Ä¶. She walked away and left me sitting there . I‚Äôll never be back here and I hope my friends stop using this business also.

I‚Äôve tried so many and the first time I tried to visit Devi‚Äôs she was on vacation. I finally was able to go back again and try her. I told her what I wanted in the beginning and let her do her magic. She slayed my eye brows and I didn‚Äôt even have to tell her to complete a touch up at the end or anything. She shaped them perfectly and removed all of the hair outside of my eye brow shape. Love that she did it in one shot and didn‚Äôt have to have me tell her to fix anything! She‚Äôs for sure the best in RI and hiiiighly recommend her, she knows how to do eyebrows!",

    "Review 2": "Hema is the only person I trust with my eyebrows. She is so professional, talented, and kind. I always leave her salon feeling confident and 100% satisfied with my experience. She is absolutely amazing I can not recommend her enough. I just had my eyebrows tinted by her for the first time and they look the best I have ever seen them. I will never go to another threader again!",

    "Review 1": "I liked the results of my eyebrows once they were done, but the attitude given to me was terribly unpleasant and unprofessional. The eye rolls, scoffs, and dirty looks were unnecessary. She then began to get pushy, even though I had said it was my first time. She crossed the line when she began pushing my head back and aggressively rearranging my hands to hold up the skin, where she was threading. She made my experience unpleasant and humiliating. Beware they are not afraid to rip the skin off your face if they don‚Äôt like you. I recommend that you teach your employees how to communicate with your customers better.",
    "Review 2": "The lady (I forgot her name unfortunately) was extremely nice the first time I went here. I was with a group of friends and she offered us free Henna because we couldn't afford it at the time. She was very nice, but very pushy. I understand that it's good to try to be pushy in business, but she crossed the line a bit. Overall, it was a pretty good experience the first time, but the second time wasn't really. We couldn't decide if we wanted to get our upper lips waxed (me and my friend) and my other friend wanted an eyebrow threading. We were sitting on the couches in front when they lady said to come to the back room with her because she wanted to show us something. We said okay although we were confused as to what she wanted to show us. She took us back and then said \"Who's first\". At this point we felt we didn't have a choice although we were very nervous to do this. We told her it was our first time and she tried to comfort us, but in a very pushy way. When it was my turn to go she started immediately (I was not ready). I kept moving because I was extremely nervous and she told me to stop, but didn't give me a chance to. When she did wax my upper lip she didn't get all of it and left remnants at the top. I wish I could have given a better review, this is just my opinion of the experience.",
    "Review 3": "My first time going there was an okay experience, this lady was tall and she did an okay job with my brows. She took a decent amount of time doing each brow. I then went to go the second time, I didn‚Äôt have the same lady, this lady was much shorter, first off I was waiting out of the store, she saw me through the reflection of the mirror, but didn‚Äôt seated me because she was ON THE PHONE. Five minutes went by and she seating me, then I saw her put on her airpods, so clearly she was on a call while doing my brows. I told her I wanted cleaning no shape nothing! She did the complete opposite! She ruined my brows! My brows used to be super thick and now they are super thin!! She also did both of my brows under 10 minutes! Worst service, highly unprofessional! I literally cried when I went home. I still paid but it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Ladies don‚Äôt go here!!!  If y‚Äôall have thick brows this isn‚Äôt the place for you!",
    "Review 4": "I left a review on this site about 6-7 months ago speaking about employees charging me extra and taking tips. On their site it is listed as $10. They charge me $12 and whenever I had cash, usually a $20, they would give me $7 back, they stole extra money from me every time. November 27th, an employee came up to me, questioned me about my review and made me change my review. She was extremely rude and she straight up ambushed me. I've gone to this place for years and I felt so disrespected. Upon speaking to her I felt ambushed, and she forced me to delete my review. She was pushy and told me to lie and say that they give good service. Never again.",
    "Review 5": "I went for upper lips and the girl name SABINA is super rude and always give me a  bad look .I never go to her. But the day I went she took me for upper lips and when I told her, that my upper lips is not clean properly, she got frustrated on me and started yelling at me and keep telling me bad stuff. Who does treat there customer's like this?? I have seen SABINA and other  girls making fun of  customer's and talk in there own Nepali language. Very unprofessional staff specifically SABINA. She thinks she owns the place and she is the boss. Lots of customers have complained, but I guess the owner Neelu does not care. Please guys do not go the girl SABINA. Neelu if you really care about your customers then you need to talk to SABINA. Being rude to customers is not going to help her neither you. Respect your customers and stop making fun and speaking in your native language in front of your customer. Guys be aware about this place. Hope some action being taken against SABINA.",

    "Review 1": "I had a membership which was great up until I needed to cancel it. I was moving out of state so I cancelled online ahead of time- but I was charged for the month. I decided to take the loss and go in one more time and informed them that I wanted to cancel due to me moving. I was told to email someone to cancel which I did immediately. The following month my card was charged again. I contacted every single location and told them I have cancelled online and emailed and they all told me that emailing was the best way to cancel. I contacted my bank at this point because it had been over a month of emailing and cancelling online and getting the run around with calling each location. My bank rectified the situation for that month and then again I find out this month I was charged AGAIN. At this point I had emailed multiple emails I was given, cancelled online multiple times and called and spoke to someone at every location with no resolution. I had to contact my bank again and request a new card because it it ridiculous that after multiple forms of communication I am still being charged for something I cant/no longer am using. Beware of getting a membership here because to cancel it is such a nightmare.",

I will never pick up a pair of tweezers again.",

I just moved back to Providence, and went to get my eyebrows done and it was a horrible experience. Not only did she take one hair out at a time, she was extremely slow so it was very painful. She also didn‚Äôt listen to me, made my eyebrows too thin, then when I tried to ask her a couple questions at the end she didn‚Äôt understand what I was trying to say. So I left crying.Such a bad experience. I really loved it here and now that I live right down the street. It is more of a hassle to go to another place. But I‚Äôm definitely not coming back. Worst threading experience in my life. And I have been getting my eyebrows threaded for 10 years.",

    "Review 3": "I have had a monthly membership with this establishment for over a year. At 17 dollars a month, I can go anytime I want, how often I want, and I always get service with a smile. In your membership, you also get free bottled water or cans of soda, plus there is a coffee machine if you so desire. Mona is my preferred eyebrow specialist as she is fantastic and makes sure there is not one hair out of place on my brows. In fact, I usually don't stop there unless I see her car parked outside. Not only does she treat me with respect, but, she also makes me feel welcomed and has this friendly vibe about her. I completely trust her with my eyebrows and that's a big deal to someone like me. I don't go anywhere else for this service! I highly recommend going at least once. I'm usually in an out within 5 minutes and there are so fast I've never spent more than 2 minutes waiting to be seen. If you're a first-timer, request Mona; you won't regret it. Two more things, there is always plenty of parking AND they are kid-friendly. They always address my 7 year old and give him a treat :) 10/10 I highly recommend!",
    "Review 4": "Today was my first time going to Threading Spot, Cumberland RI. I am absolutely AMAZED by the work and personality of Nilima.

    "Review 5": "Nilima is extremely thorough with her threading techniques. She is receptive to feedback on the areas of focus and areas to avoid. I'm happy with the results after each session and enjoy having my monthly membership at this location as I get quality work done by Nilima while helping me save.",

When I brought it to their attention they said I was the \"first\" wax of the day but it was 4 pm and I had just seen a woman leave the room before me. Long story short they are unsanitary and don't take the time to perform safe hygiene on their clients. The owner even mentioned that her employee was new and normally they don‚Äôt do that, however even after admitting that they would still not give me a refund. You're better off spending more money at a reputable place that is safe.",

    "Review 1": "Love this place. I recommend Sukhy she‚Äôs the ONLY one I trust with my brows. If she‚Äôs not there I‚Äôm not coming! Brow tinting is on point too!",
    "Review 2": "I love this place,everytime I come I leave with more than just brows done. DEB IS MY GIRL!!",
    "Review 3": "Because I came here for the first time and I‚Äôve never been treated that bad‚Ä¶ owner was straight up rude. And kept twisting and turning my head during the threading. She asked about the color I wanted for my tint and I wasn‚Äôt sure‚Ä¶. She walked away and left me sitting there . I‚Äôll never be back here and I hope my friends stop using this business also. Very unfriendly and unprofessional for a beauty business. Never again",
    "Review 4": "i have a bad experience every time i go each eyebrow comes out different and never looks the same i tell the person to fix it and they still don‚Äôt look the same i will not be coming back to this place",
    "Review 5": "First of all I don‚Äôt really review but I have to for them.. Honestly, I‚Äôve been going to Suhky‚Äôs for years and they never fail. I can say I‚Äôm so picky when it comes to my eyebrows because I don‚Äôt know how to do makeup so what‚Äôs on my face is stuck until the next time.. SHE SLAYS EVERYTIME!!! The shape, the arch, the thinness. ETC. I tell everyone to go there and I forever will!! Mind you the pictures added are from 2016. 2019. And 2022. QUALITY.",

    "Review 1": "This is the best place around. Eyebrows for $10 is so cheap and they do such a great job. The girl who did mine was so nice, did a great job, and it didn't even hurt. Best threading of my life. I highly recommend it.",
    "Review 2": "Do not waste your time here. With so many other threading places, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. First and last time coming here. They do not know the art of eyebrow shaping, nor how to shape a thick eyebrow. You get what you pay for, and if you care about your eyebrows and how they look, pay an extra $5 more and you will be much more satisfied.",

    "Review 5": "I told her as soon as I sat in her chair that I was trying to grow out my eyebrows and just wanted them cleaned up and realized it was taking her quite a bit to do. She told me one eyebrow was different than the other, which I had told her I have been working on letting them fill in and she ended up reshaping them and getting rid of the growth I had. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend especially when you ask for a specific request of just cleaning them up.",

    "Review 2": "I went today to get my eyebrows done and unfortunately I won‚Äôt be returning. Not once but twice they messed up my brows.  This time I got two different shapes.  It‚Äôs not first time time they have done them there before but the last two ladies it‚Äôs not know what they aware doing.  I have the shape all you have to do is clean around them.  Sorry but won‚Äôt be returning.    1/17/ 2020 After an unfortunate visit I surprised, the owner reached out and wanted to know what happed.  Glad she reached out And fixed my eyebrows.  I will return to her location thank you!",
    "Review 3": "I've never been to this location usually go to the Pawtucket one but the same ladies work in all of them. There was only one woman there but she was quick and efficient never left anybody waiting more than a few minutes. I went for a threading and tint, she was gentle thank God cuz a couple of them... mannn... and she did a okay job on them. tbh there's only one lady that gets my brows exactly the way I like them but I go there like once every couple months just to remind me where to pluck, n I don't see her much so I always forget her name.",
    "Review 4": "This place is very clean and tidy! They do a beautiful job with the threading and they come out perfectly even each time! Their pricing is also very fair. I highly recommend!",
    "Review 5": "I was reading someone‚Äôs review and I had the exact same experience my eyebrows got messed up two different shapes. I always have to let them regrow before I can go back hoping this time they won‚Äôt get messed up. Sadly they do. Some might ask why do I keep going there; because I went there before and this lady did a great job hope to find her there again. Anyways I saw that the owner reached out to the lady and did them her self hopefully she‚Äôll see this and reach out!",

    "Review 1": "Completely shocked at how I was just treated by the older woman who works here. I‚Äôm from out of state looking to get my brows done and this place had good reviews. They woman asked what shape and I said please just clean them up and keep them thick as possible. She said your eyebrows are different shape and sizes. Made me feel uncomfortable and not very nice. I said I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs how they grow.. she was very condescending. Then when I was done she asked me to look in the mirror and my eyes were watery (as they always are bc I have contacts and holding my eyes) so she asks if she made me cry?? Very odd experience. Then she rung me out- I didn‚Äôt feel like tipping but I gave less than I would have. Will not return. As a small business owner- it would be nice to treat people nicely. So many other nice businesses out there that I would rather spend money on:/",
    "Review 2": "I love coming here to clean my eyebrows. Very affordable, make sure to bring cash or use an onsite ATM",
    "Review 3": "I have been going here for over 10 years. They do an absolutely amazing job. I hate to write negative things on this business because I really do love them but the younger girl needs a little bit more training -it absolutely kills when she threads my eyebrows. They still look very nice though but i would prefer the two other women that have been here for years",
    "Review 4": "I don‚Äôt ever write reviews, but I just have to share that I have been visiting unique eyebrow threading since they opened in 2007. I would never think of going anywhere else but here. The staff is amazing and I just love the owner! I always walk out happy and my eyebrows and my lip come out perfect every single time!! If you are thinking about going to get your eyebrows threaded believe me it is much better than waxing and plucking like I do sometimes when I don‚Äôt have time lol this is the absolute best place to get services!",
    "Review 5": "I like going to the older lady in the first chair I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs the owner but she always does an excellent job. The few times I‚Äôve went to the younger girl in the second chair she messed up my eyebrows and had me in the chair for under a minute before she told me that I was done. I mentioned clean up only and not too thin and always leaves them super thin or a completely different shape from one another  because she rushes.",

    "Review 1": "My eyebrows and I have been on a crazy journey together for the last 20 years between shaving, waxing, plucking to threading. Sometimes they look good and sometimes I leave with no eyebrows at all, until now. I am so happy to have found this hidden gem. My eyebrows are absolutely perfect, and I leave more confident than before. I loved coming here so much I signed up for the monthly memberships and now get my whole face threaded. I highly recommend coming here to for all your threading needs.",

    "Review 2": "This is a beautiful store. I highly recommend for anyone into spirituality, Buddhism, prayer, crystals, witchcraft, or just curious about Indian, native, or Buddhist culture. This place is a great source of ritual and cultural supplies that may be hard to come-by in their authentic form. They are genuine products, not like you would find on amazon, and are sourced from a small business. They have beautiful jewelry, books, lots of crystals, clothing, incense, and amazing d√©cor. They also offer henna and tarot card readings. They staff is always friendly and happy to help or teach you about their specialties. Always worth a visit, and affordable prices. This is a genuine store that I love!",

    "Review 4": "While a bit musky, this niche store is packed with goods ranging from authentic Indian cultural items, to Hinduism, as well as to mysticism. Staff are generally helpful and the prices are OK.",
    "Review 5": "Spectrum India is a Thayer Street staple! I've been coming here since high school and it truly is a fantastic store. Yes, there are cheaper things on Amazon, but this is the only place where you can chat with Jagdish, while you're picking out your crystals and scarves. My bangle collection is out of this world after almost 20 years of stopping in after dinner at Andreas.",

    "Review 3": "Because I came here for the first time and I‚Äôve never been treated that bad‚Ä¶ owner was straight up rude. And kept twisting and turning my head during the threading. She asked about the color I wanted for my tint and I wasn‚Äôt sure‚Ä¶. She walked away and left me sitting there . I‚Äôll never be back here and I hope my friends stop using this business also. Very unfriendly and unprofessional for a beauty business. Never again",

The shape, the arch, the thinness. ETC. I tell everyone to go there and I forever will!! Mind you the pictures added are from 2016. 2019. And 2022. QUALITY.",
