    "Review 1": "This is a beautiful store. I highly recommend for anyone into spirituality, Buddhism, prayer, crystals, witchcraft, or just curious about Indian, native, or Buddhist culture. This place is a great source of ritual and cultural supplies that may be hard to come-by in their authentic form. They are genuine products, not like you would find on amazon, and are sourced from a small business. They have beautiful jewelry, books, lots of crystals, clothing, incense, and amazing décor. They also offer henna and tarot card readings. They staff is always friendly and happy to help or teach you about their specialties. Always worth a visit, and affordable prices. This is a genuine store that I love!",
    "Review 2": "I've been shopping there since I was young now my daughter shopping here and it's still the same place I love it",
    "Review 3": "While a bit musky, this niche store is packed with goods ranging from authentic Indian cultural items, to Hinduism, as well as to mysticism. Staff are generally helpful and the prices are OK.",
    "Review 4": "Loved the different varieties of sage! Can't wait to try the white sage with dried rose petals. It's gonna smell amazing! Great spot! Glad I came in",
    "Review 5": "Spectrum India is a Thayer Street staple! I've been coming here since high school and it truly is a fantastic store. Yes, there are cheaper things on Amazon, but this is the only place where you can chat with Jagdish, while you're picking out your crystals and scarves. My bangle collection is out of this world after almost 20 years of stopping in after dinner at Andreas.",

    "Review 2": "I had ordered two falls for my sarees. Desiclik was very quick in shipping and delivering the product. Only issue was selecting the right shade of red. I was just lucky that the red I got matched with my saree color. Probably if you reach out to them, they may help you with the right shade as well.",

    "Review 5": "I can trust DESICLIK for future online order. Service was excellent and price was comparable with other sellers. If service and price is comparable as expected in future, we are going to be repeated customer. We are placing another order soon!!",

    "Review 1": "Love this place. I recommend Sukhy she’s the ONLY one I trust with my brows. If she’s not there I’m not coming! Brow tinting is on point too!",
    "Review 2": "I love this place,everytime I come I leave with more than just brows done. DEB IS MY GIRL!!",
    "Review 3": "Because I came here for the first time and I’ve never been treated that bad… owner was straight up rude. And kept twisting and turning my head during the threading. She asked about the color I wanted for my tint and I wasn’t sure…. She walked away and left me sitting there . I’ll never be back here and I hope my friends stop using this business also. Very unfriendly and unprofessional for a beauty business. Never again",
    "Review 4": "i have a bad experience every time i go each eyebrow comes out different and never looks the same i tell the person to fix it and they still don’t look the same i will not be coming back to this place",
    "Review 5": "First of all I don’t really review but I have to for them.. Honestly, I’ve been going to Suhky’s for years and they never fail. I can say I’m so picky when it comes to my eyebrows because I don’t know how to do makeup so what’s on my face is stuck until the next time.. SHE SLAYS EVERYTIME!!! The shape, the arch, the thinness. ETC. I tell everyone to go there and I forever will!! Mind you the pictures added are from 2016. 2019. And 2022. QUALITY.",
