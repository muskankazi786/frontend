    "Review 1": "My Daughter is 12 years old, She ordered the butter chicken for her and Myself so we could go to the drive in theater. We had to wait an hour and the other patrons had big bags of food. The highest price I heard the rude lady say was $57.65. and he had a lot of food, she hands Me the small bag and says $70.00 ok no problem but when My Daughter went in the bag to get her food. Everything was for 1 person, a small box of Jasmine Rice and a container of butter chicken that we could not eat individually. The hostess was rude I felt overcharged for our food purposely and we couldn't eat til we got home. I paid close to $100 for bad service and the kids running around the food in the kitchen where customers can see them. I would bring many to them but I don't want to be embarrassed because of their service. Rude lady should take a course on being a good hostess.",
    "Review 2": "We were traveling from Massachusetts to New York when we came across this restaurant and so glad we found it. It was really late and all other restaurants on the way had closed for the day. We were starving and just happened to call them to see if they were open. We reached just as they were about to close but the owners were kind to let us dine in. We had veg biryani, paneer kadai and garlic naan. Biryani ani kadai was good. The naan was slightly uncooked. The dahi raita was sour and slightly butter so we couldn't eat it. Overall good experience. The decor was nice, restrooms were clean.",
    "Review 3": "Had a dinner here with my colleague. We ordered Amritsari Dal, bhindi and garlic naans. For appetizers we wanted gobi manchurian which was not on menu but we asked. Hostess suggested we try gobi 65 which was not on menu either but she said chef will make it. It was amazing. Crunchy gobi with lots of flavor. Dal and Bhindi was awesome too. Naans we‚Äôre one of the best. It is very authentic Punjabi restaurant so if you want to eat good Punjabi food, go here.",
    "Review 4": "This is the best Indian food I have had since moving to this area. The samosas are excellent and the Chicken Vindaloo is the best I have every had. It is perfectly spicy and vinegary. If you enjoy spicy food, I highly recommend their Vindaloo. I‚Äôm sure the lamb and veggie Vindaloo would be great as well. Excellent garlic naan as well. I will absolutely be back soon!",
    "Review 5": "We enjoyed our time here. The server was quick to get the appetizer running but the entrees took longer than we expected it to be. The goat biryani was amazing as well as the chicken kadhai.",

That was the first time we tried Indian cuisine and‚Ä¶OMG‚Ä¶ we fell in love   The interior is absolutely beautiful, stylish and vibrant. The food was irresistible delicious, we couldn‚Äôt stop eating until we finished our meal to the very last crumble on the plate. Our overall experience was terrific. Thanks to the owner for the love, attention to the details and care of their place. I wish your business  prosperity for years and hope one day we‚Äôll come back",

Very disappointing. This has to be a joke. I hope the restaurant see‚Äôs this as an error.",
    "Review 5": "Wow. This is Excellent Indian. Chennai is truly a must try.  This is as authentic Indian as you will find here in Rhode Island. I am in awe that a place this amazing sits in a hole in the wall on Reservoir Ave.  Everytime I am here the restaurant is filled with individuals enjoying their meal. Smiling, laughing and sharing time over great food. High praise to the family at Chennai for bringing us wonderful food with great flavor. You can tell they love what they do. You can taste the love in the food. Great job Chennai and thank you! We will see you soon. Pictures are of Tikki Massala and I tried the Kadai Chicken. Delish and something new for a lot of individuals.",

    "Review 1": "Nice tasty food worth the money.. less oily, cooked to perfection and satisfies your taste buds!!",
    "Review 2": "My husband is from India and gets homesick occasionally for really authentic Indian meals. We came for the Sunday buffet and this absolutely hit the spot. The food is so fresh and the staff are very attentive. Great service all around. We'll definitely be back!",
    "Review 3": "Hit or miss. First time try was good so we went again and had a bad experience. The dosa, Gobi Manchuria was good. Bajji was so oily that I had to squeeze out oil. Kadai paneer was ok. We had to mix in salt and pepper to bring it to taste. Not an experience I want to have when paying good price. One another customer was so mad with the food that they were going to call the department of health for serving frozen expired food!",
    "Review 4": "The shrimp was so overcooked that it was like we were chewing on rubber. The food overall was just below average in flavor profile and execution. The only reason that this place gets a 2 star is because of how kind and welcoming the wait staff was.",
    "Review 5": "One of the best South Indian Restaurant in the area! Huge menu and all delicious! They serve lunch buffet and they even serve the Bahubali Thali - which has 50 items on the plate! I love the biryanis, Chile bhature, Idli and Dosa!",

    "Review 3": "Incredible experience at India Restaurant. The ambiance was first-rate. The server was helpful, friendly, and attentive.

    "Review 4": "I had never ventured into Indian food until meeting my partner in 2019. He finally got to take me to India and he can do it again. The door opens and the smell of curry ignites your hunger. Everything is cooked to perfection. The taste is better than imagined. Venture out and try India.",
    "Review 5": "India is one of Providence's best restaurants in general and a cultural gem for the city. The atmosphere, lighting, and general feel of the setting is perfect to match their menu. Service was excellent, very helpful in catering to any special requests. Food was delicious as expected. Many seating options, inside and outside, the menu is very fairly priced for the quality of food you are getting. A great selection of cocktails and drinks to choose from, typically busy on weekend nights but they also have an in house Henna artist doing free henna work available to patrons, a great opportunity.",

The food is exceptional and freshly prepared if eating in like we did or with take out.

The service was personable and so very attentive and I know that Sahara will take good care of you too! Don't miss out on this local gem!",

We marveled at how clean everything was including the restroom. Service was sweet and our ice teas were marvelous. In the mood for Indian food, this is the place to go.",

Healthy to eat everyday as well which i discovered from here fresh tasty yummy food üç± Thanks Andi",
    "Review 4": "The taste and quality of the food here is always consistent and tasty. The owner is very humble and willing to hear out to customers. The idlis are like a pieces of cloud and Dosa qualifies the golden color check (unlike the ghost dose that most restaurants serve). Must try if you are in this area.",
    "Review 5": "Their South Indian food cuisine is top notch, especially their dosas and chole bahture! Although the space is small there is a lot of love! The owner of the restaurant was very kind and helpful.",

    "Review 2": "Wonderful restaurant.  Service was a bit scattered, but I am giving servers a pass during the pandemic.  Most importantly, the food was delicious!  I live spicy food, but I have learned not the ask for \"hot\" in an Indian restaurant.  Medium was just fine to give me the kick I wanted without intense pain.  I had goat, and it melted in my mouth.  My wife had a vegan avocado dish.  She couldn't stop singing it's praises.  We came here to celebrate our 26th anniversary and we weren't disappointed.",
    "Review 3": "Good naan and tasty sauce. $2 extra for garlic naan vs plain naan. Dry chicken. Slow in dining service. Attentive water refills. Quiet and not busy. On the expensive side of things. Entrees can be portioned into 2 servings.",
    "Review 4": "Amazing, amazing, amazing! We were walking past this new restaurant and wanted to check it out. The food came out just amazing, the naans were full of onion and garlic making it the best we have ever tried. We also tried the fried okras which is 10/10. The cauliflower tasted great too. The waitress Ritu was also very knowledgeable and recommended some of the dishes that were outside of our comfort zone and tasted great! Will definitely come back!",
    "Review 5": "Let me first start off by saying that the food was very authentic and fresh, and I highly recommend a visit.  My only knock was most likely due to a staffing shortage, as 1 person was visible doing everything to wait on all tables.  Food took a while to arrive.",

    "Review 4": "Average food, staff lacks interest. not allergy aware, told me they could not guarantee specific ingredient will not be in my food (lemon juice). when asked for a piece of onion, informed me it will cost $2.25 for \"Indian salad\". I have never ever been charged extra for a piece of onion in any Indian restaurant before this.",
    "Review 5": "Great samosas, great garlic naan, great mango lassi, and great papadams. Their chicken tikka masala is also excellent and the lunch portion is generous. Reason for the four star review is their chicken vindaloo. It really lacked the spice, tang, and the wow factor that I usually get from a great vindaloo. It‚Äôs my go to dish and this left me very disappointed. However, everything else was so good I‚Äôll definitely be back and will try something else!",

Yet when it comes to Indian, we are looking for a local business that serves intoxicatingly aromatic and great food, to  return to over and over again. Punjab is that place. Fresh food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. That and all at the best prices within 20 miles of any establishment serving Indian around!?  Moments from 295 right there on plainfield pike, so do not miss out!! You will not be sorry!",

You don't normally see that! Our waiter was attentive and friendly! Even brought out a spice he wanted us to try and it was amazing! Really, felt like a VIP or something at this place! Oh and their menu, literally is amazing!",
    "Review 5": "Ordered food to go and it was ready in a flash and still nice and hot when we ate it.  Had butter chicken and ordered medium heat which was the right amount for me.  Also ordered garlic naan and ginger/honey naan.  Both good. Lots and lots of ginger so it you do not like whole ginger this wouldn‚Äôt be for you. I happen to love it so was delighted. Very clean and easy to find.  Will dine in next time for the full experience.  Portions a little smaller than our typical go to place for Indian food - that‚Äôs the only reason for the 4 stars.",
